# Falcon-Ethers

**Falcon-Ethers** is a JavaScript-based project developed by [LACNetNetworks](https://github.com/LACNetNetworks) that integrates the Falcon post-quantum digital signature scheme into Ethereum smart contract interactions using the [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) library. This project aims to enhance blockchain security by incorporating quantum-resistant cryptographic methods.

## Features

- **Post-Quantum Security**: Implements the Falcon signature algorithm to provide resistance against quantum computing attacks.
- **Ethereum Integration**: Facilitates interaction with Ethereum smart contracts through ethers.js.
- **Modular Design**: Structured for easy integration and extension within blockchain applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LACNetNetworks/falcon-ethers.git
